# PLANNING.md

This document provides comprehensive context about the LangGraph-Go project, including architecture, development guidelines, and implementation strategy.

## Project Overview

**TBD** - We will define the high-level purpose, goals, and target users for the LangGraph-Go framework.

## Architecture

### Core Components

**TBD** - We will define the main architectural layers:

- Data layer
- Service layer
- Configuration management
- Other key components

### Data Model

**TBD** - We will document the data model, including:
- Key entities and their relationships
- State management approach
- Persistence strategy
- Database schema (if applicable)

## API Endpoints

**TBD** - We will document any exposed endpoints:
- RESTful API routes (if applicable)
- GraphQL schema (if applicable)
- gRPC services (if applicable)
- Or note if this is a library without external endpoints
