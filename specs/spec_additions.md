What still worries me (high-impact items)
	1.	Formal invariants are implied, not guaranteed. The README asserts “deterministic ordering,” but I don’t see a crisp, testable contract for how order is computed (e.g., fixed order_key derived from topology and edge index) and applied at both dispatch and merge time. Document the ordering function and assert it in tests. (Your Concurrency Guide link suggests intent; surface the exact rule in README or Go doc comments.)  ￼
	2.	Exactly-once semantics need to be unmissable. You mention “Production Ready” with backpressure/timeouts/retries, but the README doesn’t spell out the atomic step commit (state + frontier + outbox + idempotency mark in one transaction). Add a short “Atomic Step Commit” sub-section pointing to the store impl.  ￼
	3.	Replay guardrails. Replay is advertised, but you should make mismatch behavior explicit: if the request hash differs (e.g., different prompt params), fail hard with a named error (ErrReplayMismatch) and log where divergence occurred. The Replay Guide link is great—drop a one-liner in README so users expect failure on drift.  ￼
	4.	Observability: promise vs. proof. README lists “Event Tracing” and “Observability,” but doesn’t explicitly say “OpenTelemetry spans with run/step/node attributes” or Prom metrics names. Add an emit/otel example (or doc snippet) so operators know exactly what they’ll get.  ￼

Concrete additions I recommend now

A. Make determinism contractual
	•	Freeze the ordering rule in docs + code comments. e.g., “Within a step, work items are started and merged by ascending order_key = sha256(parent_path || node_id || edge_index).” Put that in the Concurrency Guide and README “Concurrent Execution” block.  ￼
	•	Ship tests that prove it. Example: 3 parallel branches updating the same fields; assert merge log matches static edge indices even under artificial sleeps.

B. Elevate the store contract
	•	Document the transactional API. A “Store Guarantees” doc: single-tx step commit; idempotency keys; an outbox pattern for emitters. Link it from README “Persistence.”  ￼
	•	Add a sqlite store for dev. Low friction for new users; keep MySQL/Aurora for prod. Mention both under /graph/store.  ￼

C. Replay that actually saves you at 2 a.m.
	•	Record/Replay schema. Document “what gets recorded”: request payload (redacted), response, provider IDs, timing, token counts, and a content hash. Mention drift behavior (fast-fail) and how to diff runs (e.g., a simple CLI that prints the first diverging node). Link from the Replay Guide and show a 10-line code sample.  ￼

D. Observability you can grep
	•	OpenTelemetry emitter: spans for run/step/node with attrs {run_id, step_id, node_id, attempt, order_key, tokens_in, tokens_out, latency_ms, cost_usd}.
	•	Prometheus metrics: langgraph_inflight_nodes, langgraph_queue_depth, langgraph_step_latency_ms, langgraph_retries_total, langgraph_merge_conflicts_total, langgraph_backpressure_events_total. Add a 30-line example in examples/tracing/.  ￼

E. API polish (small, visible ROI)
	•	Functional options everywhere. graph.New(reducer, store, emitter, WithMaxConcurrent(8), WithQueueDepth(1024), WithDefaultTimeout(30*time.Second), WithConflictPolicy(ConflictFail)). Reduces churn as you add knobs.  ￼
	•	Typed errors. Export ErrNoProgress, ErrReplayMismatch, ErrBackpressure, ErrMaxStepsExceeded and document them. Users will write control-flow around these.
	•	Cost accounting. If your LLM adapters expose token counts, ship a tiny cost package and add cost_usd to node spans.

Bench & test plan you should add to CI
	•	Deterministic replay: run → record → replay; assert byte-identical final state and identical event hashes. Inject a param drift to assert ErrReplayMismatch. (Point to Replay Guide from test docs.)  ￼
	•	Out-of-order completion: add random sleeps; assert final merge order equals static edge order.  ￼
	•	Backpressure: set QueueDepth=1, enqueue 2+, ensure second blocks then cancels cleanly; verify backpressure_events_total.  ￼
	•	Hedged retries (if/when you add them): ensure exactly-once delta application.
	•	Deadlock/no-progress: zero-progress cycle triggers ErrNoProgress.
	•	RNG determinism: seed stored in checkpoint; a node reading ctx.Value(Rand) yields identical sequence on replay.

Docs gaps to close
	•	Conflict policy. README says “deterministic results,” but you should say what happens on conflicting deltas (default ConflictFail vs. LastWriterWins vs. CRDT hook). Put the default in README and the Concurrency Guide.  ￼
	•	Human-in-the-loop. Examples list “interactive workflow”; document the built-in “pause + resume” semantics (timeout? resume token? where is the input persisted?). If not done yet, say “planned” to avoid confusion.  ￼
	•	LLM streaming. If token streaming is supported, state it plainly and show the event shape (delta, seq_no) in docs; if not yet, mark as roadmap to avoid over-expectation.  ￼

Competitive posture

A short “Why Go” / “Why This vs. Python LangGraph” table in README would help newcomers. Right now the README nods at inspiration; give a crisp parity + differentiators table (type safety, single binary, deterministic replay defaults, worker-pool semantics). Link to LangGraph docs for terminology alignment.  ￼

⸻

TL;DR — what I’d merge next
	1.	Docs: one paragraph in README on Atomic Step Commit & Idempotency, plus explicit ordering function and default ConflictPolicy.  ￼
	2.	Emitters: ship emit/otel with a tiny tracing example; list metric names in README.  ￼
	3.	Tests: add a det_replay and merge_ordering CI suite and link them from the Concurrency and Replay guides.  ￼
	4.	Dev UX: add store/sqlite for frictionless local runs; keep MySQL/Aurora for prod.  ￼

If you want, I’ll draft:
	•	the README deltas (atomic commit, ordering, conflict policy),
	•	a minimal emit/otel exporter + tracing example,
	•	and the two CI tests (replay + merge ordering).
