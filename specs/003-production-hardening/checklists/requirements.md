# Specification Quality Checklist: Production Hardening and Documentation Enhancements

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification successfully translates technical recommendations from spec_additions.md into user-facing requirements with clear acceptance criteria and measurable success metrics.

The specification covers:
- 7 user stories prioritized by impact (3 P1, 2 P2, 2 P3)
- 32 functional requirements organized by user story
- 12 measurable success criteria
- 9 key entities explained in business terms
- Clear scope boundaries (in/out of scope)
- 7 open questions for future consideration

Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan`.
