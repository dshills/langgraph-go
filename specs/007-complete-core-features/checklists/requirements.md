## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASS

All quality checks passed. The specification is:
- Complete and unambiguous
- Technology-agnostic
- Testable with clear acceptance criteria
- Ready for planning phase

## Notes

Specification is based on comprehensive codebase review (`specs/incomplete-functionality-review.md`). All three user stories address real gaps identified through analysis of 78 skipped tests and 35 TODO markers. Functional requirements map directly to incomplete functionality documented in review.
