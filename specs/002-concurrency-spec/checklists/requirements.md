# Specification Quality Checklist: Concurrent Graph Execution with Deterministic Replay

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Assessment
- **No implementation details**: ✓ The spec focuses on behavior and outcomes without specifying Go-specific implementation details like package names, struct definitions, or implementation patterns. Configuration parameters like `MaxConcurrentNodes` are treated as conceptual requirements.
- **User value focus**: ✓ All user stories describe developer needs (performance, debugging, resource control) without diving into technical implementation.
- **Stakeholder accessibility**: ✓ Written in business language with clear explanations of why each feature matters.
- **Mandatory sections**: ✓ All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are present and complete.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- **No clarification markers**: ✓ The specification is complete with no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All design decisions are documented in Assumptions section.
- **Testable requirements**: ✓ All 30 functional requirements are specific and verifiable (e.g., "MUST propagate context cancellation to all running nodes within 1 second").
- **Measurable success criteria**: ✓ All 12 success criteria include specific metrics (percentages, time limits, counts).
- **Technology-agnostic criteria**: ✓ Success criteria focus on observable outcomes without implementation details (e.g., "Graphs with 5 independent nodes complete in 20% of sequential time" rather than "Go goroutines execute concurrently").
- **Acceptance scenarios**: ✓ All 5 user stories have Given-When-Then scenarios that can be independently tested.
- **Edge cases**: ✓ 8 edge cases identified covering conflicts, failures, timeouts, and replay issues.
- **Scope boundaries**: ✓ Clear In Scope / Out of Scope sections define what is and isn't included.
- **Dependencies**: ✓ 6 external dependencies identified (store, context package, OpenTelemetry, etc.).

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- **Acceptance criteria**: ✓ Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories.
- **Primary flow coverage**: ✓ User stories cover parallel execution (P1), deterministic replay (P1), resource control (P2), cancellation (P2), and retry logic (P3).
- **Measurable outcomes**: ✓ Success criteria provide clear targets for validating feature completion (e.g., "100% of replays produce identical results").
- **Implementation leak check**: ✓ No Go-specific code, package structure, or implementation patterns appear in the spec.

## Conclusion

**Status**: ✅ SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase.

No issues require resolution. The spec successfully translates the technical concurrency design document into a stakeholder-friendly requirements document with clear acceptance criteria and measurable outcomes.
