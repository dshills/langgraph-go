## Performance Comparison

### Before (v0.1.x)
- Sequential execution only
- No checkpoint replay
- Manual retry logic required
- Basic observability

### After (v0.2.0)
- ✅ Concurrent execution with 3-5x speedup
- ✅ Deterministic checkpoint replay
- ✅ Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- ✅ Enhanced observability with concurrency attributes
- ✅ Transactional event outbox
- ✅ Idempotency protection

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Version (v0.2.0)
1. **No Queue Depth Limits**: MaxConcurrentNodes partially enforced, full backpressure deferred (US3)
2. **No Timeout Enforcement**: Per-node and run-level timeouts designed but not implemented (US4)
3. **No Cancellation Propagation**: Context cancellation partially supported, full propagation deferred (US4)
4. **Simple Conflict Resolution**: Only last-writer-wins, advanced policies documented (FR-025)
5. **Single Process Only**: No distributed execution across machines

### Recommended Workarounds
1. **Queue Management**: Use smaller MaxConcurrentNodes values
2. **Timeouts**: Implement timeouts in node code
3. **Cancellation**: Use context.WithCancel at application level
4. **Conflicts**: Design reducers to avoid conflicts
5. **Distributed**: Run multiple independent processes
