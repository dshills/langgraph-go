# Implementation Tasks: Concurrent Graph Execution with Deterministic Replay

**Feature**: Concurrent Graph Execution with Deterministic Replay
**Branch**: `002-concurrency-spec`
**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md) | **Plan**: [plan.md](./plan.md)

## Overview

This document provides a complete, dependency-ordered task breakdown for implementing concurrent graph execution with deterministic replay. Tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each feature increment.

**Total Tasks**: 78 tasks across 7 phases
**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 weeks
**MVP Scope**: Phase 3 (User Story 1 - Parallel Execution) = 18 tasks

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP-First Approach
- **Phase 3 (US1)** delivers the core value: parallel node execution with deterministic merging
- Can ship to production after Phase 3 completion
- Phases 4-6 add reliability features incrementally

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- Within each phase, tasks marked `[P]` can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Test tasks can run parallel to implementation of unrelated components
- Store/Emitter enhancements can proceed independently

### TDD Enforcement (CRITICAL)
- **Constitution Principle III**: ALL tests MUST be written BEFORE implementation
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced
- Pre-commit review with `mcp-pr` mandatory for concurrency code
