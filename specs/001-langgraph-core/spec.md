# Feature Specification: LangGraph-Go Core Framework

**Feature Branch**: `001-langgraph-core`
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "review ./specs/SPEC.md for project specifications"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Build Stateful Workflow with Checkpointing (Priority: P1)

As a developer building an AI agent system, I need to define a multi-step reasoning workflow
that can be interrupted and resumed from any point, so that long-running LLM operations can
survive crashes, timeouts, or user interruptions without losing progress.

**Why this priority**: Core value proposition - deterministic replay and resumable execution
distinguish this framework from simpler orchestration tools. Without this, the framework is
just a basic graph executor.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a simple 3-node workflow, saving state
after each step, terminating the process, and resuming from the saved checkpoint to complete
the workflow. Delivers the fundamental guarantee of stateful recovery.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a workflow with 5 sequential nodes, **When** the process crashes after node 3
   completes, **Then** the workflow can resume from node 4 using persisted state
2. **Given** a workflow executing node 2, **When** execution is interrupted mid-node,
   **Then** the last completed state (from node 1) is available for replay
3. **Given** a completed workflow run, **When** examining the execution history,
   **Then** every state transition from start to finish is retrievable for debugging

---

### User Story 2 - Define Dynamic Routing with Conditional Logic (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I need to create workflows where the next step depends on the current state,
so that my AI agent can make decisions (like "ask clarifying questions" vs "provide answer")
based on intermediate results.

**Why this priority**: Essential for non-trivial workflows. Without conditional routing,
developers can only build linear pipelines. This enables loops, branches, and adaptive behavior.

**Independent Test**: Create a workflow with a "judge" node that routes to different next
nodes based on state values (e.g., confidence score < threshold → retry node, else → done).
Verify correct routing occurs for different state scenarios.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a workflow with a decision node checking "confidence > 0.8", **When** state
   shows confidence = 0.9, **Then** execution proceeds to the "finalize" node
2. **Given** the same workflow, **When** state shows confidence = 0.6, **Then** execution
   loops back to the "refine" node
3. **Given** a workflow with three conditional branches, **When** none match, **Then** a
   clear error is raised indicating no valid route found

---

### User Story 3 - Execute Parallel Node Branches (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I need to fan out execution to multiple nodes that run concurrently, then
merge their results, so that my workflow can parallelize independent operations (like querying
multiple data sources simultaneously).

**Why this priority**: Performance optimization feature. Workflows are functional without
this, but it enables significant speedups for I/O-bound operations like multiple LLM calls
or API requests.

**Independent Test**: Create a workflow that fans out to 3 parallel nodes (each taking 1
second), verify all complete in ~1 second total (not 3 seconds sequential), and merged state
contains results from all three branches.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fan-out node with 4 parallel branches, **When** execution reaches that node,
   **Then** all 4 branches execute concurrently with isolated state copies
2. **Given** parallel execution completes, **When** results merge at join node, **Then**
   state contains combined results from all branches using the reducer function
3. **Given** one parallel branch fails with error, **When** others succeed, **Then** error
   is captured in merged state and workflow can handle it gracefully

---

### User Story 4 - Integrate LLM Providers (Priority: P4)

As a developer, I need to call different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local models)
within workflow nodes using a consistent interface, so that I can swap providers or use multiple
models without rewriting workflow logic.

**Why this priority**: Key differentiator for LLM workflows, but workflows should work with
any async operation. This makes the framework LLM-friendly without being LLM-only.

**Independent Test**: Create a single workflow that calls three different LLM providers in
sequence, verify each returns results in the expected format, and workflow state accumulates
all responses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a node configured to call OpenAI GPT-4, **When** node executes with a prompt,
   **Then** response text and token usage are available in the node result
2. **Given** a workflow using Anthropic Claude, **When** the provider's API is unavailable,
   **Then** the error is captured and workflow can retry or route to fallback
3. **Given** nodes calling different providers, **When** examining execution events,
   **Then** all LLM calls are logged with timestamps, providers, and latencies for observability

---

### User Story 5 - Debug Execution with Event Tracing (Priority: P5)

As a developer, I need to observe every step of workflow execution with detailed events, so
that I can diagnose unexpected behavior, measure performance bottlenecks, and understand
complex multi-step reasoning chains.

**Why this priority**: Critical for production use but not required for initial MVP. Developers
can build workflows without full observability, but they'll struggle to debug issues.

**Independent Test**: Run a workflow that executes 10 nodes with various state transitions,
export the execution trace, and verify every node entry/exit, state change, and routing decision
is captured with timestamps and metadata.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a running workflow, **When** any node starts execution, **Then** a "node_start"
   event is emitted with runID, step number, nodeID, and timestamp
2. **Given** a node completes with state changes, **When** examining events, **Then** both the
   delta (what changed) and merged state (current total state) are available
3. **Given** a completed workflow, **When** exporting to OpenTelemetry or structured logs,
   **Then** the entire execution trace can be visualized as a timeline with spans

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a workflow reaches the configured maximum step limit without terminating?
  System should halt execution and return error indicating infinite loop detected.

- How does the system handle a node that takes longer than any reasonable timeout?
  Context cancellation should propagate through the workflow, allowing graceful shutdown
  with state persisted at last completed step.

- What happens when trying to resume from a checkpoint that doesn't exist?
  System should return clear error indicating checkpoint not found, with available options.

- How does concurrent state merging handle conflicting updates from parallel branches?
  Reducer function is responsible for merge logic; system guarantees deterministic order
  of reducer calls for reproducible results.

- What happens when a workflow is defined with nodes but no edges and no explicit routing?
  Single-node workflows are valid and should execute that one node then terminate.

- How does the system handle circular dependencies in routing logic?
  MaxSteps limit prevents infinite loops; developers must design finite workflows.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow developers to define workflow nodes that accept state and
  return modified state with routing instructions

- **FR-002**: System MUST persist workflow state after each node execution to enable resumption
  from any point

- **FR-003**: System MUST support conditional routing where next node is determined by
  examining current state

- **FR-004**: System MUST enable parallel execution of independent nodes with isolated state
  copies that merge deterministically

- **FR-005**: System MUST capture errors at the node level and make them available in state
  for downstream decision-making

- **FR-006**: System MUST emit events for every significant execution step (node start/end,
  state changes, routing decisions) to enable observability

- **FR-007**: System MUST enforce configurable limits (maximum steps, retry attempts) to
  prevent runaway execution

- **FR-008**: System MUST support saving and loading named checkpoints at arbitrary points
  in execution for developer-controlled resumption

- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a way to integrate external operations (LLM calls, API
  requests, database queries) within nodes without coupling to specific providers

- **FR-010**: System MUST guarantee deterministic replay, where re-executing a workflow
  from the same checkpoint with the same inputs produces identical state transitions

- **FR-011**: System MUST allow workflows to terminate explicitly (success) or implicitly
  (max steps, unhandled errors)

- **FR-012**: System MUST support both simple function-based nodes and structured node
  implementations for flexibility

### Key Entities

- **Workflow**: A complete directed graph defining the execution flow, consisting of nodes
  connected by edges with conditional predicates. Represents the developer's orchestration logic.

- **Node**: A processing unit that receives state, performs computation (LLM call, tool
  invocation, logic), and returns state modifications with routing instructions. Can be
  simple functions or complex implementations.

- **State**: The accumulated context flowing through the workflow, containing all data needed
  for decision-making. Must be serializable for persistence.

- **Execution Run**: A specific instance of a workflow being executed, identified by a unique
  runID. Tracks progression through nodes and maintains state history.

- **Checkpoint**: A saved snapshot of execution state at a specific step, allowing resumption
  from that point. Can be automatic (every step) or manual (developer-labeled).

- **Event**: An observability record capturing what happened during execution (which node,
  what state, when, any errors). Used for debugging, monitoring, and audit trails.

- **Edge**: A connection between nodes with optional conditional logic that determines whether
  that path is taken based on current state.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can define a 10-node workflow, execute it partially, terminate the
  process, and resume from any saved checkpoint within 100ms of startup time

- **SC-002**: A workflow with 5 parallel branches completes in time proportional to the
  slowest branch, not the sum of all branches (demonstrating true concurrency)

- **SC-003**: Execution traces capture 100% of node transitions, state changes, and routing
  decisions with sub-millisecond timestamp resolution

- **SC-004**: Developers can replay any historical workflow run and observe identical state
  transitions, proving deterministic behavior

- **SC-005**: System handles workflows with 100+ nodes and 1000+ execution steps without
  performance degradation or excessive memory usage

- **SC-006**: Error scenarios (node failures, timeouts, invalid routing) are captured in
  state and events, allowing workflows to handle 90%+ of errors gracefully without crashes

- **SC-007**: Developers can swap LLM providers (OpenAI ↔ Anthropic ↔ local model) with
  zero changes to workflow logic, demonstrating provider abstraction

- **SC-008**: Conditional routing correctly handles 100% of test cases including edge
  conditions like no matching route, multiple matching routes, and infinite loop prevention

## Scope *(mandatory)*

### In Scope

- Core workflow execution engine with node orchestration
- State persistence and checkpoint management
- Conditional routing and dynamic control flow
- Parallel node execution with deterministic merging
- Event emission for observability
- LLM provider integrations via adapter pattern
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Execution history and replay capability
- Configuration for limits (max steps, retries, timeouts)

### Out of Scope

- Visual workflow editor (future extension)
- HTTP/GraphQL API for remote execution (future extension)
- Built-in authentication or authorization (framework is library, not service)
- Workflow versioning and migration tools (v1 feature set)
- Distributed execution across multiple machines (future CRDT-based feature)
- Real-time collaboration on workflow definitions
- Workflow marketplace or template library
- Language bindings for non-Go environments

## Assumptions *(mandatory)*

1. **Target Users**: Developers building AI agent systems, LLM orchestration pipelines, or
   complex stateful workflows in Go. Assumed comfortable with Go programming and basic
   concurrency concepts.

2. **Deployment Environment**: Workflows run as in-process libraries, not as separate services.
   Persistence uses developer-provided storage (in-memory for tests, database for production).

3. **State Size**: Individual workflow states are reasonably sized (<10MB typical) and can
   be serialized to JSON efficiently. Not designed for streaming gigabyte-scale data.

4. **Execution Duration**: Most workflows complete in seconds to minutes. Long-running
   workflows (hours/days) are supported via checkpoints but not the primary use case.

5. **Concurrency Model**: Parallel nodes execute via goroutines. Developers are responsible
   for ensuring node operations are goroutine-safe if accessing shared resources.

6. **Error Handling Philosophy**: Errors are data, not exceptions. Workflows should handle
   errors explicitly via conditional routing, not rely on panic/recover.

7. **Determinism Guarantee**: Assumes node operations are themselves deterministic or
   developers accept non-determinism (e.g., LLM outputs may vary even with same inputs).

8. **Performance Expectations**: Suitable for human-scale workflows (seconds per node) where
   LLM/API latency dominates. Not optimized for microsecond-scale high-frequency execution.

## Open Questions

None - this specification represents a well-defined feature set derived from the technical
design document. Implementation details are deferred to the planning phase.

## Dependencies *(mandatory)*

### Blocking Dependencies

None - this is a greenfield project with no existing system dependencies.

### Integration Points

- **LLM Provider SDKs**: OpenAI Go SDK, Anthropic SDK, Google Generative AI SDK for LLM
  integrations. These are optional adapter dependencies, not core framework requirements.

- **Persistence Storage**: Developers will integrate their own databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL,
  etc.) by implementing the storage interface. Framework provides in-memory implementation
  for testing.

- **Observability Systems**: Optional integration with OpenTelemetry, structured logging
  libraries, or custom event consumers via the emitter interface.

## Constraints *(mandatory)*

### Technical Constraints

- **Programming Language**: Must be implemented in Go (language choice driven by type safety,
  concurrency primitives, and target developer community)

- **Serialization Format**: State must be JSON-serializable for portability and human
  readability during debugging

- **Concurrency Primitive**: Must use native Go goroutines and channels (no external actor
  frameworks or coroutine libraries)

### Business Constraints

- **Open Source License**: MIT license required (specified in project charter)

- **Zero-Cost Core**: Framework core must have no runtime costs (no required cloud services,
  paid APIs, or licensing fees)

### Regulatory Constraints

None - this is a developer library with no data retention, user privacy, or compliance
requirements at the framework level. Applications built with the framework may have their
own regulatory requirements.
