# Specification Quality Checklist: LangGraph-Go Core Framework

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks complete

### Detailed Review

**Content Quality**:
- Specification is written from developer's perspective (the user of this library framework)
- Focuses on WHAT developers need (stateful workflows, checkpointing, routing) and WHY (enable resumable LLM operations, adaptive behavior, parallel execution)
- No leaked implementation details - specification describes behavior, not code structure
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Scope, Assumptions, Dependencies, Constraints) are present and complete

**Requirement Completeness**:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are well-defined from the technical spec
- All 12 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-012) are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008) are measurable with specific metrics (time, percentages, counts)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic: "Developers can define a 10-node workflow" not "Engine class implements Run method"
- Each of 5 user stories has 2-3 acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- Edge cases section identifies 6 boundary conditions with expected behaviors
- Scope section clearly separates in-scope (9 items) from out-of-scope (8 items)
- Dependencies section lists integration points without requiring specific versions
- Assumptions section documents 8 key assumptions about users, environment, and expectations

**Feature Readiness**:
- All functional requirements map to user stories (FR-001/002 → US1, FR-003 → US2, FR-004 → US3, etc.)
- User scenarios are independently testable as specified (P1-P5 prioritized, each can be MVP)
- Success criteria validate the user stories (SC-001 validates US1 checkpointing, SC-002 validates US3 parallelism, etc.)
- No implementation leakage detected: specification avoids Go syntax, package names, struct definitions

## Notes

This specification successfully transforms the technical SPEC.md document into a user-focused feature specification following Specify framework guidelines. It maintains the design goals (deterministic replay, type safety, composability, production-ready) while removing implementation details (interfaces, generic types, package structure).

The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate the technical implementation plan.
