# Tasks: LangGraph-Go Core Framework

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-langgraph-core/`
**Prerequisites**: spec.md, plan.md
**Project**: Go framework for stateful, graph-based LLM workflows

**TDD Approach**: Per constitution.md, ALL tasks follow Test-Driven Development:
- Tests written BEFORE implementation
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle enforced
- Each implementation task has corresponding test task(s)

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `- [X/checkbox] [TaskID] [P?] [Story] Description with file path`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- File paths use `/graph` as root package

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (US1) only - delivers core checkpoint/resume functionality
**Incremental Delivery**: Each user story is independently testable and deliverable
**Priority Order**: US1 (P1) → US2 (P2) → US3 (P3) → US4 (P4) → US5 (P5)

**Current Status**: Phase 1-8 Complete (67%), Phase 9-11 Remaining (33%)
