# Feature Specification: Multi-LLM Code Review Workflow

**Feature Branch**: `004-multi-llm-code-review`
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a workflow for running code review on a code base using all available LLMs. It should review in batches of files so that it will work on any size code base. At the end it should bring all the llm feedback into a single prioritized document. store in examples"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Batch-Based Code Review Execution (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to review their entire codebase using multiple LLM providers to get diverse feedback on code quality, security, and best practices. The system processes files in manageable batches to avoid memory and token limit issues, allowing review of codebases of any size.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - without batch processing, the workflow cannot handle real-world codebases. It's the foundation that makes multi-LLM review feasible.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the workflow on a test codebase with 100+ files and verifying that all files are processed in batches without errors or memory issues.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a codebase with 500 Go files, **When** the developer runs the multi-LLM review workflow, **Then** the system processes all files in batches of 10-50 files (configurable batch size) without exceeding memory or token limits
2. **Given** the workflow is processing batch 3 of 10, **When** the developer checks progress, **Then** the system shows current batch number, total batches, and files processed so far
3. **Given** a batch processing fails due to network timeout, **When** the workflow retries the batch, **Then** the workflow continues from the failed batch without reprocessing completed batches
4. **Given** a codebase with mixed file types, **When** the workflow runs, **Then** the system only processes relevant code files (e.g., .go, .py, .js) and skips non-code files

### User Story 2 - Multi-LLM Provider Integration (Priority: P1)

A developer wants feedback from multiple AI language model providers on the same codebase to get diverse perspectives on code quality issues. Each AI provider may catch different problems based on their training and strengths.

**Why this priority**: This is what differentiates this tool from single-LLM review tools. Multiple perspectives increase the likelihood of catching issues and provide comparative insights.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running a single file through all configured AI providers and verifying that each provider returns unique feedback that gets captured in the results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the developer has configured API keys for three AI providers, **When** the workflow runs, **Then** each batch is reviewed by all three AI providers concurrently
2. **Given** one AI provider is unavailable or returns an error, **When** the workflow continues, **Then** the other AI providers complete their reviews and the final report notes which provider failed
3. **Given** different AI providers have different processing limits, **When** processing large files, **Then** the system adapts batch sizes per provider to stay within their constraints
4. **Given** a developer only has API keys for two out of three providers, **When** the workflow runs, **Then** the system uses only the available providers and completes successfully

---

### User Story 3 - Prioritized Consolidated Report (Priority: P1)

After all AI providers have reviewed the codebase, a developer needs a single consolidated report that aggregates all feedback, removes duplicates, and prioritizes issues by severity and frequency across AI providers.

**Why this priority**: Without consolidation, developers would face hundreds of individual review comments from multiple AI providers. A prioritized report makes the feedback actionable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing mock feedback from 3 AI providers on 10 files and verifying that the output is a single markdown document with issues ranked by priority (critical/high/medium/low) and duplicate issues merged.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** three AI providers have completed reviews of a 100-file codebase, **When** the consolidation phase runs, **Then** the system produces a single markdown report with all issues grouped by severity (critical, high, medium, low, informational)
2. **Given** two AI providers flag the same issue (e.g., "missing error handling in function X"), **When** consolidating feedback, **Then** the report shows the issue once with a note that multiple AI providers identified it
3. **Given** issues vary in severity from style suggestions to security vulnerabilities, **When** generating the report, **Then** critical security issues appear first, followed by high-priority bugs, then code quality issues, then style suggestions
4. **Given** the consolidated report is generated, **When** a developer opens it, **Then** each issue includes: file path, line number (if available), severity level, description, which AI providers flagged it, and suggested remediation

---

### User Story 4 - Configuration and Customization (Priority: P2)

A developer wants to customize the review workflow by specifying which AI providers to use, what file types to review, what aspects to focus on (security, performance, style), and where to store results.

**Why this priority**: This enables flexibility for different teams and projects. Teams can optimize for their specific needs (e.g., security-focused reviews, performance audits).

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a configuration file that specifies a single AI provider, reviews only .go files, focuses on security, and verifying the workflow respects these settings.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer creates a config file specifying only security and performance review focus, **When** the workflow runs, **Then** AI providers receive prompts instructing them to focus on security vulnerabilities and performance issues, excluding style feedback
2. **Given** a configuration specifies batch size of 25 files, **When** processing a 200-file codebase, **Then** the system processes exactly 8 batches of 25 files each
3. **Given** a developer wants to exclude test files from review, **When** the config specifies `exclude_patterns: ["*_test.go", "*.test.js"]`, **Then** the workflow skips all test files
4. **Given** a configuration specifies output location as `./code-review-results/`, **When** the workflow completes, **Then** all reports and artifacts are stored in that directory

---

### User Story 5 - Progress Tracking and Resumability (Priority: P2)

During a long-running review of a large codebase, a developer wants to see real-time progress updates and the ability to resume if the workflow is interrupted.

**Why this priority**: Large codebases may take significant time to review. Progress visibility and resumability prevent wasted time and resources.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by starting a review of 500 files, interrupting it after batch 3, and restarting to verify it resumes from batch 4 without reprocessing.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the workflow is processing batch 5 of 20, **When** the developer checks status, **Then** the system displays: "Processing batch 5/20 (25%), Current batch: files 101-125, Provider A (completed), Provider B (in progress), Provider C (pending)"
2. **Given** the workflow crashes or is interrupted during batch 8, **When** the developer restarts the workflow, **Then** the system detects checkpoint data and resumes from batch 9
3. **Given** a review has been running for 45 minutes, **When** the developer wants to know estimated completion time, **Then** the system provides an estimate based on average batch processing time
4. **Given** the workflow completes successfully, **When** the developer views the final summary, **Then** the system shows total files reviewed, total issues found per severity, time taken, and per-provider statistics

### Edge Cases

- **Empty or Invalid Codebase**: What happens when the specified directory contains no code files or doesn't exist? System should validate the path and provide clear error messages.
- **AI Provider Rate Limiting**: How does the system handle API rate limits from AI providers? System should implement exponential backoff and retry logic, potentially pausing between batches.
- **Extremely Large Files**: What happens when a single file exceeds the processing limit of all AI providers? System should either skip the file with a warning or split it into chunks for review.
- **Incomplete API Keys**: What happens when a developer has only configured one out of three possible AI providers? System should proceed with available providers and note missing providers in the report.
- **Disk Space Issues**: What happens when writing the consolidated report or checkpoint data fails due to insufficient disk space? System should detect disk space before starting and fail gracefully with clear error messages.
- **Concurrent Modifications**: What happens if the codebase is modified while the review is running? System should use file checksums or timestamps to detect changes and optionally re-review modified files.
- **Binary or Unreadable Files**: How does the system handle binary files or files with encoding issues? System should skip non-text files and log encoding errors without crashing.

## Assumptions *(mandatory)*

- Developers have valid API keys for at least one supported AI language model provider with code analysis capabilities
- The codebase to be reviewed is stored in a local filesystem directory accessible to the workflow
- Supported programming languages for review include: Go, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, C/C++, Rust (expandable to others)
- Average file size in the codebase is between 100-1000 lines of code
- Developers have sufficient API quota/credits with their AI provider subscriptions to complete the review
- The output directory has sufficient disk space for storing checkpoints and reports (estimated at 10-50 MB per 1000 files reviewed)
- Network connectivity to AI provider APIs is available throughout the review process
- Review prompts for AI providers are pre-defined templates that emphasize code quality, security, performance, and best practices
- Default batch size is 20 files but can be configured based on average file size and AI provider processing limits
- The workflow runs as a command-line example application that demonstrates the framework's capabilities
- Deduplication of issues uses fuzzy matching on file path, line number proximity (±5 lines), and issue description similarity
- AI provider responses are expected to return structured feedback with issue severity, description, and location information

## Dependencies *(include if applicable)*

- **Graph-Based Workflow Engine**: The workflow requires a graph execution engine capable of orchestrating multi-step workflows with state management and checkpointing
- **AI Language Model API Access**: Requires API access to at least three different AI language model providers with code analysis capabilities
- **File System Access**: Workflow requires read access to the target codebase directory and write access to the output directory
- **Configuration Management**: Workflow reads configuration from a structured configuration file specifying providers, batch size, filters, and focus areas

## Out of Scope *(include if applicable)*

- **Automatic Code Fixes**: The workflow provides feedback but does not automatically apply fixes to the codebase
- **IDE Integration**: This is a command-line tool; integration with VS Code, IntelliJ, or other IDEs is not included
- **Real-Time Review**: The workflow is batch-based; it does not provide real-time feedback as developers write code
- **Custom LLM Providers**: Only OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are supported; adding custom or self-hosted LLM providers is out of scope
- **Pull Request Integration**: The workflow does not integrate with GitHub/GitLab PR workflows or post comments directly on PRs
- **Historical Trending**: The workflow does not track code quality trends over time or compare reviews across commits
- **Interactive Chat**: Developers cannot ask follow-up questions to LLMs about specific issues; feedback is one-way
- **Language-Specific Linting**: The workflow does not replace language-specific tools like golangci-lint, pylint, or ESLint; it provides higher-level architectural and semantic feedback
