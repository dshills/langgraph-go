# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-LLM Code Review Workflow

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Validation Date**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: âœ… PASSED

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

All validation items passed successfully. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

### Changes Made During Validation

- Removed specific LLM provider names (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) and replaced with generic "AI provider" terminology
- Removed specific SDK package references from Dependencies section
- Replaced implementation-specific references (LangGraph-Go) with generic "graph-based workflow engine" terminology
- Updated Success Criteria to be technology-agnostic (e.g., changed "per LLM provider" to "across all AI providers")
- Ensured all functional requirements focus on WHAT the system must do, not HOW it should be implemented

## Notes

Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to proceed with implementation planning.
