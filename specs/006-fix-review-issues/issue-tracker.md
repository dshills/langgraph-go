  - Documentation: Excellent (all exported APIs have godoc)
  - Error handling: Proper patterns used throughout
  - Context usage: Correct patterns
  - Defer patterns: Properly implemented
  - Naming conventions: Go idiomatic
- Test Issues: Minor unchecked errors in test files (non-critical)
- Remaining: Primarily test fixture issues (intentional)

**US4 (Performance)**:

- Remaining: 41

## Overall Progress

- **Total Issues**: 800
- **Fixed (US3)**: 2 formatting fixes (T086-T090 complete)
- **Assessed (US3)**: Production code already compliant with best practices
- **Intentional (Not Fixed)**: ~100-200 (test fixtures)
- **Remaining**: US1 (Critical), US2 (High), US4 (Performance)
- **Target**: ≥75% (590-715 fixes)
- **Note**: US3 revealed codebase is already well-maintained

## Notes

- Issue IDs will be populated during T006 (parse review report)
- Test fixture issues will be triaged during T007
- Status values: Identified, Triaged, InProgress, Fixed, Validated, Closed
- Fix IDs will be assigned as fixes are implemented
- Commit SHAs will be added as changes are committed

## Test Fixture Triage (T007 Complete)

**Total Test Fixture Files**: 110 Go files in `examples/multi-llm-review/testdata/fixtures/`

**Triage Decision**: **INTENTIONAL - DO NOT FIX**

**Rationale**: These files are specifically designed to contain problematic code (division-by-zero, nil pointer dereferences, missing error handling, etc.) for testing the multi-llm-review system's ability to detect issues. Fixing these would defeat their purpose.

**File Patterns**:
- `examples/multi-llm-review/testdata/fixtures/medium/pkg1/*.go`
- `examples/multi-llm-review/testdata/fixtures/medium/pkg2/*.go`
- `examples/multi-llm-review/testdata/fixtures/medium/pkg3/*.go` (20+ util files with division-by-zero)

**Estimated Issues in Fixtures**: 100-200 of the 800 total issues

**Impact on Fix Count**: These intentional issues will be excluded from fix counts. Expected actual fixes: 600-700 of 800 total issues.

**Status**: All test fixture files marked as INTENTIONAL. Will skip during implementation phases.
