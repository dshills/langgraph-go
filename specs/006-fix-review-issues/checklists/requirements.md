# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-LLM Code Review Issues Resolution

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
- Specification avoids implementation details and focuses on WHAT needs to be fixed rather than HOW
- User stories are written from developer/auditor perspective which are the key stakeholders
- Language is clear and accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete based on the review report
- All 18 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous (e.g., "MUST address all 76 critical security issues")
- Success criteria include specific metrics (e.g., "zero runtime panics", "80% coverage", "20%+ improvement")
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic and user-focused (e.g., "test suite passes", "no crashes")
- Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format and are concrete
- Edge cases comprehensively cover false positives, test fixtures, breaking changes, low consensus issues, and validation
- Scope is bounded with clear Out of Scope section
- Dependencies and Assumptions sections are thorough

### Feature Readiness - PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in the user stories
- Four user stories cover the complete scope: Critical (P1), High Priority (P2), Best Practices/Style (P3), Performance (P4)
- Success criteria SC-001 through SC-010 provide comprehensive measurable outcomes
- No implementation details present - specification focuses on outcomes not implementation

## Notes

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is complete, well-structured, and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.plan`).

Key strengths:
- Clear prioritization of 800 issues across 4 user stories
- Comprehensive coverage of all issue categories from review report
- Realistic success criteria with measurable metrics
- Good balance between being specific about issues and avoiding implementation details
- Clear distinction between production code fixes and test fixture considerations
