# Quickstart: Critical Concurrency Bug Fixes

**Feature**: 005-critical-bug-fixes  
**Date**: 2025-10-29

## N/A - No User-Facing Quickstart Needed

**Justification**: This feature consists of internal bug fixes that are transparent to users. There are no new features to demonstrate, no API changes to document, and no new usage patterns to teach.

### What Changed (For Developers)

**Before (Buggy)**:
```go
// Same code as before - but had hidden race conditions
engine := graph.New(reducer, store, emitter, 
    graph.WithMaxConcurrent(8))

result, err := engine.Run(ctx, "run-001", initialState)
// Could deadlock, race, or produce non-deterministic results
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```go
// Exact same code - now works correctly!
engine := graph.New(reducer, store, emitter, 
    graph.WithMaxConcurrent(8))

result, err := engine.Run(ctx, "run-001", initialState)
// Now: no deadlocks, no races, deterministic results guaranteed
```

### What Users Will Notice

**Improvements** (no code changes required):
- Workflows no longer hang under high concurrency
- Deterministic replay produces consistent results across runs
- All errors are properly reported (no silent failures)
- Concurrent execution is more reliable and predictable

**Migration Required**: None - fully backward compatible

---

**Conclusion**: No quickstart guide needed. Users continue using the framework exactly as before, but with critical bugs fixed. Existing examples and documentation remain valid.

For testing: Run existing code with `go test -race` to verify race conditions are resolved.
