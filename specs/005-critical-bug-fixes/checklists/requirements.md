# Specification Quality Checklist: Critical Concurrency Bug Fixes

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Result**: âœ… PASS - All requirements met

**Specification Quality**: HIGH
- Clear user value (production stability, debugging reliability)
- Measurable success criteria (100% error delivery, zero race conditions)
- Well-defined scope (4 critical bugs, excludes architectural refactoring)
- Testable requirements with specific scenarios
- No ambiguity or clarification needed

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` - Implementation planning phase

**Key Strengths**:
- User stories prioritized by criticality (P1 > P2)
- Each story independently testable
- Concrete edge cases identified from review findings
- Success criteria include performance impact bounds (5% throughput, 10% memory)
- Clear separation from out-of-scope architectural work
