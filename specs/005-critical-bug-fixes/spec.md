# Feature Specification: Critical Concurrency Bug Fixes

**Feature Branch**: `005-critical-bug-fixes`  
**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Fix critical concurrency bugs and race conditions identified in comprehensive code review including results channel deadlock, RNG thread safety violations, frontier ordering issues, and completion detection races

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Reliable Workflow Execution Under High Concurrency (Priority: P1)

As a developer using LangGraph-Go for production workloads, I need workflows to execute reliably without deadlocks, race conditions, or silent failures when multiple nodes run concurrently, so that my application remains stable and predictable under load.

**Why this priority**: This is critical for production deployment. Without these fixes, concurrent workflows can hang indefinitely, produce non-deterministic results, or silently drop errors - all of which are unacceptable for production systems.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running workflows with 10-100 concurrent nodes under stress conditions (rapid task execution, context cancellations, simultaneous errors) and verifying all executions complete successfully with proper error reporting.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple workers processing nodes concurrently, **When** one node fails with an error and the results channel is at capacity, **Then** the error is delivered to the caller and the workflow terminates properly without hanging
2. **Given** 10 workers executing nodes simultaneously, **When** all workers request random numbers for retry backoff, **Then** each worker receives consistent random values without data races
3. **Given** rapid concurrent work item submissions to the frontier queue, **When** items have different priority OrderKeys, **Then** items are dequeued in strict OrderKey order regardless of submission timing
4. **Given** workers completing at different rates, **When** the last work item finishes processing, **Then** workflow completion is detected immediately without premature or delayed termination

### User Story 2 - Deterministic Replay Remains Functional (Priority: P1)

As a developer debugging production issues, I need deterministic replay to produce identical results across executions, so that I can reliably reproduce and diagnose problems without the results being corrupted by race conditions.

**Why this priority**: The deterministic replay feature is a core value proposition of LangGraph-Go. Thread safety violations in RNG and frontier ordering break this guarantee, making the feature unreliable.

**Independent Test**: Execute the same workflow 100 times with identical inputs and verify all executions produce byte-for-byte identical final states and execution traces.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a workflow with retry logic and random backoff, **When** executed multiple times with the same runID, **Then** all retry delays are identical across runs
2. **Given** a workflow with 5 parallel branches, **When** replayed 50 times, **Then** state merge order is identical in all replays
3. **Given** a recorded workflow execution, **When** replayed with strict mode enabled, **Then** no replay mismatch errors occur due to non-deterministic behavior

---

### User Story 3 - Graceful Error Reporting (Priority: P2)

As an operations engineer monitoring production workflows, I need all errors to be properly reported through observability systems, so that I can diagnose failures and take corrective action without workflows silently hanging.

**Why this priority**: Error visibility is essential for operational excellence. Silent error drops make debugging nearly impossible and can mask serious system problems.

**Independent Test**: Inject errors into concurrent workflows and verify all errors appear in logs, metrics, and execution results with no silent failures.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple concurrent nodes failing simultaneously, **When** the results channel reaches capacity, **Then** all errors are either delivered or logged before workflow termination
2. **Given** a workflow execution, **When** monitoring error metrics, **Then** error counts match actual failure events with no undercounting
3. **Given** context cancellation during execution, **When** workers attempt to report errors, **Then** errors are either delivered or workflow terminates gracefully without hanging

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when MaxConcurrentNodes workers all fail simultaneously and fill the results channel?
- How does the system handle context cancellation during RNG seed initialization?
- What if frontier receives enqueue notifications but heap is empty (desynchronization)?
- How are completion signals handled if the last worker completes while completion check is running?
- What happens when multiple workers decrement inflightCounter to zero simultaneously?
- How does the system behave when RNG is accessed from context but context value is nil?
- What if a worker completes between frontier.Len() check and inflightCounter.Load() check?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST ensure all workflow errors are delivered to the caller without silent drops or indefinite hangs
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide thread-safe random number generation for all concurrent workers with deterministic seeding
- **FR-003**: System MUST dequeue work items in strict OrderKey priority order regardless of concurrent submission timing
- **FR-004**: System MUST detect workflow completion immediately when frontier is empty and all workers are idle
- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent race conditions between completion detection and worker counter updates
- **FR-006**: System MUST allocate sufficient results channel capacity to handle concurrent error scenarios
- **FR-007**: System MUST use per-worker RNG instances derived from a deterministic seed to prevent data races
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain heap as single source of truth for work item ordering with channel as notification mechanism
- **FR-009**: System MUST use atomic operations or proper synchronization for all shared state accessed by concurrent workers
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle context cancellation gracefully without goroutine leaks or resource exhaustion

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: All concurrency fixes MUST pass race detector testing (`go test -race`)
- **NFR-002**: Workflow execution throughput MUST not degrade by more than 5% after fixes
- **NFR-003**: Memory allocation per workflow execution MUST not increase by more than 10%
- **NFR-004**: All fixes MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing public APIs
- **NFR-005**: Deterministic replay MUST continue to produce identical results across 1000+ executions

### Key Entities

- **Worker**: Concurrent goroutine executing nodes from the frontier queue
- **Results Channel**: Buffered channel collecting node execution outcomes from all workers
- **RNG Instance**: Random number generator with deterministic seed for retry backoff calculations
- **Frontier**: Priority queue ordering work items by OrderKey for deterministic execution
- **Completion State**: Combination of frontier emptiness and worker idle status indicating workflow termination
- **Inflight Counter**: Atomic counter tracking number of actively executing nodes

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Workflows execute 1000 times consecutively without deadlocks, hangs, or race condition panics
- **SC-002**: Race detector reports zero data races across all concurrent execution tests
- **SC-003**: 100 parallel workflow executions with identical inputs produce byte-for-byte identical final states
- **SC-004**: Error injection tests show 100% error delivery rate with zero silent drops
- **SC-005**: Frontier ordering tests verify 100% compliance with OrderKey sequence across 10,000 work item submissions
- **SC-006**: Completion detection accuracy reaches 100% with zero premature or delayed terminations across varied workload patterns
- **SC-007**: Worker throughput remains within 5% of baseline after concurrency fixes
- **SC-008**: Memory allocation per workflow increases by less than 10% compared to current implementation

## Assumptions

- Current test suite provides baseline for regression testing
- Results channel capacity of MaxConcurrentNodes*2 is sufficient for error scenarios
- Per-worker RNG derivation maintains deterministic replay guarantees
- Heap-based ordering with notification channel maintains acceptable performance
- Context cancellation patterns in existing code are mostly correct
- Backward compatibility must be preserved (no breaking API changes)

## Out of Scope

- Architectural refactoring (Engine decomposition) - addressed in separate feature
- Checkpoint API consolidation - addressed in separate feature
- Performance optimizations beyond concurrency fixes - addressed in separate feature
- Test coverage improvements beyond race condition validation - addressed in separate feature
- Model adapter improvements - not related to concurrency bugs
- Store interface simplification - addressed in separate feature

## Dependencies

- Existing test suite must pass before fixes begin
- Race detector (`go test -race`) must be available for validation
- Benchmark suite should exist to measure performance impact
- Current goroutine lifecycle patterns must be well understood
- Documentation of current concurrency architecture (frontier, workers, completion detection)

## Future Considerations

- These fixes lay groundwork for future performance optimizations
- Improved concurrency safety enables higher MaxConcurrentNodes limits
- Fixed determinism enables reliable replay for debugging production issues
- Cleaner error handling patterns can be extended to other subsystems
- Thread-safe patterns established here apply to future concurrent features
