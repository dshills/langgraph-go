# T085-T086: Integration Test Status

## Summary
Integration test for consolidated reports with deduplication has been implemented in `graph_test.go` but cannot be executed due to an import cycle issue in the codebase that is currently being refactored.

## Test Implementation

### Location
- File: `/Users/dshills/Development/projects/langgraph-go/examples/multi-llm-review/workflow/graph_test.go`
- Lines: 978-1240
- Test Name: `TestConsolidatedReport_WithDuplicates`
- Helper Type: `MockCodeReviewerWithDuplicates`

### Test Coverage
The test validates all US3 acceptance criteria:

✅ **Deduplication** (US3 Scenario 2)
- Creates 3 mock providers that return identical issues
- Verifies duplicate issues are merged into single ConsolidatedIssue entries
- Confirms consolidated count is less than total issue count

✅ **Consensus Score Calculation** (US3 Scenario 2)
- Verifies consensus score = providers_flagging_issue / total_providers
- Example: 3/3 = 1.0 for issues flagged by all providers
- Validates score is rounded to 2 decimal places

✅ **Provider Attribution** (US3 Scenario 4)
- Verifies each consolidated issue lists all providers that flagged it
- Confirms provider names are correctly populated (openai, anthropic, google)
- Validates provider list is sorted consistently

✅ **Report Format** (US3 Scenario 4)
- Validates file path is present
- Validates line number is valid (>= 0)
- Validates severity is populated
- Validates description is present
- Validates remediation is present
- Validates provider list is populated
- Validates issue ID is generated

✅ **Severity Grouping** (US3 Scenario 3)
- Verifies issues are categorized by severity (critical, high, medium, low, info)
- Validates only valid severity levels are used
- Confirms severity distribution is tracked

### Mock Implementation
`MockCodeReviewerWithDuplicates` returns 4 identical issues per file across all providers:
1. **Critical**: SQL injection vulnerability (line 10)
2. **High**: Nil pointer dereference (line 25)
3. **Medium**: Function complexity (line 50)
4. **Low**: Variable naming convention (line 75)

This ensures robust testing of deduplication logic with predictable, identical inputs.

## Import Cycle Issue

### Problem
The codebase has an import cycle:
```
workflow -> consolidator -> types
(but workflow/state.go still defines types that should be in types package)
```

### Root Cause
- **Timestamp Evidence**: `workflow.test` binary from Oct 29 08:10 (tests were passing)
- **Breaking Change**: consolidator package modified at Oct 29 09:38-09:43
- **Refactoring**: Types moved from `workflow` package to new `types` package
- **Incomplete**: workflow/state.go still defines types instead of importing from types package

### Current State
```bash
$ go test ./workflow/
# github.com/dshills/langgraph-go/examples/multi-llm-review/workflow
package github.com/dshills/langgraph-go/examples/multi-llm-review/workflow
	imports github.com/dshills/langgraph-go/examples/multi-llm-review/consolidator from nodes.go
	imports github.com/dshills/langgraph-go/examples/multi-llm-review/workflow from deduplicator.go: import cycle not allowed
```

## Resolution Path

### Step 1: Complete Type Migration
Update `workflow/state.go` to import and use types from the `types` package:

```go
package workflow

import "github.com/dshills/langgraph-go/examples/multi-llm-review/types"

// Use types.ReviewState instead of defining ReviewState locally
// Use types.CodeFile, types.ReviewIssue, types.ConsolidatedIssue, etc.
```

### Step 2: Update All References
Find and replace references throughout workflow package:
- `ReviewState` → `types.ReviewState`
- `CodeFile` → `types.CodeFile`
- `ReviewIssue` → `types.ReviewIssue`
- `ConsolidatedIssue` → `types.ConsolidatedIssue`
- `Batch` → `types.Batch`
- `Review` → `types.Review`

### Step 3: Move Reducer Function
Move `ReduceReviewState` function from `workflow/state.go` to a more appropriate location, possibly:
- Keep in workflow package (as it's workflow-specific logic)
- Ensure it operates on `types.ReviewState`

### Step 4: Run Tests
Once the import cycle is resolved:
```bash
go test -v -run TestConsolidatedReport_WithDuplicates ./workflow/
```

## Expected Test Results

Once the import cycle is resolved, the test should:
1. Discover ~10 .go files in testdata/fixtures/small
2. Process files in 2 batches (batch size 5)
3. Generate 40 total issues (4 issues × 10 files)
4. Receive identical issues from all 3 providers (120 total before dedup)
5. Consolidate down to 40 unique issues (deduplication rate ~67%)
6. Verify each issue has all 3 providers listed
7. Verify consensus scores are 1.0 (3/3 providers agree)
8. Confirm report path is set
9. Confirm workflow completes successfully

## Files Modified

### `/Users/dshills/Development/projects/langgraph-go/examples/multi-llm-review/workflow/graph_test.go`
- **Lines Added**: 263 lines (978-1240)
- **New Test**: `TestConsolidatedReport_WithDuplicates`
- **New Mock**: `MockCodeReviewerWithDuplicates`
- **Status**: ✅ Code complete, awaiting import cycle resolution

## Next Steps
1. Complete the types package refactoring (update workflow/state.go)
2. Resolve the import cycle
3. Run `go test ./workflow/` to execute all tests including the new one
4. Verify test output matches expected results
5. Report completion with test results

## Notes
- Test implementation follows existing patterns in graph_test.go
- Uses real file scanner on testdata/fixtures/small for realistic testing
- Comprehensive assertion comments map to US3 acceptance criteria
- Mock provider returns predictable, identical issues for reliable deduplication testing
