# LangGraph-Go

A Go-native orchestration framework for building **stateful, graph-based LLM and tool workflows**.

> **⚠️ Alpha Software Warning**
>
> LangGraph-Go is currently in **alpha** stage. The API is not yet stable and may change significantly between releases. While the core functionality is complete and tested, we recommend:
> - **Not using in production** without thorough testing
> - **Pinning to specific versions** in your go.mod
> - **Expecting breaking changes** until v1.0.0
> - **Reporting issues** to help us improve stability
>
> We welcome early adopters and contributors! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to get involved.

## Overview

LangGraph-Go enables you to build complex AI agent systems with:
- **Deterministic replay** - Resume workflows from any checkpoint
- **Type-safe state** - Strongly-typed state management using Go generics
- **Flexible routing** - Conditional logic, loops, and parallel execution
- **LLM integration** - Unified interface for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and local models
- **Production-ready** - Built-in persistence, observability, and error handling

## Quick Start

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "os"

    "github.com/dshills/langgraph-go/graph"
    "github.com/dshills/langgraph-go/graph/emit"
    "github.com/dshills/langgraph-go/graph/store"
)

// Define your state type
type Session struct {
    Query  string
    Answer string
    Steps  int
}

// Create a reducer for state merging
func reduce(prev, delta Session) Session {
    if delta.Query != "" {
        prev.Query = delta.Query
    }
    if delta.Answer != "" {
        prev.Answer = delta.Answer
    }
    prev.Steps += delta.Steps
    return prev
}

func main() {
    // Create nodes
    process := graph.NodeFunc[Session](func(ctx context.Context, s Session) graph.NodeResult[Session] {
        return graph.NodeResult[Session]{
            Delta: Session{Answer: "Processed: " + s.Query, Steps: 1},
            Route: graph.Stop(),
        }
    })

    // Build the workflow
    st := store.NewMemStore[Session]()
    emitter := emit.NewLogEmitter(os.Stdout, false)
    opts := graph.Options{MaxSteps: 10}

    engine := graph.New(reduce, st, emitter, opts)
    engine.Add("process", process)
    engine.StartAt("process")

    // Execute
    ctx := context.Background()
    final, err := engine.Run(ctx, "run-001", Session{Query: "Hello LangGraph!"})
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    fmt.Println(final.Answer) // Output: Processed: Hello LangGraph!
}
```

## Installation

```bash
# Install latest version (may include breaking changes)
go get github.com/dshills/langgraph-go

# Recommended: Pin to a specific version
go get github.com/dshills/langgraph-go@v0.1.0
```

**Note:** Since this is alpha software, we recommend pinning to a specific version in your `go.mod` to avoid unexpected breaking changes.

## Core Concepts

### Nodes

Nodes are processing units that receive state, perform computation, and return state modifications:

```go
type Node[S any] interface {
    Run(ctx context.Context, state S) NodeResult[S]
}
```

### State & Reducers

State flows through the workflow and is merged using reducer functions:

```go
type Reducer[S any] func(prev S, delta S) S
```

### Routing

Control flow with conditional routing:

```go
// Explicit routing
graph.Goto("next-node")
graph.Stop()

// Conditional edges
engine.Connect("nodeA", "nodeB", func(s Session) bool {
    return s.Confidence > 0.8
})
```

### Persistence

Automatic checkpointing enables workflow resumption:

```go
// Save checkpoint
engine.SaveCheckpoint("after-step-1")

// Resume from checkpoint
engine.LoadCheckpoint("after-step-1")
final, err := engine.Run(ctx, runID, initialState)
```

### Concurrent Execution

**New in v0.2.0**: Execute independent nodes in parallel with deterministic results:

```go
// Enable concurrent execution with worker pool
opts := graph.Options{
    MaxConcurrentNodes: 10,  // Execute up to 10 nodes in parallel
    QueueDepth:         1000, // Frontier queue capacity
}

engine := graph.New(reducer, store, emitter, opts)

// Graph with parallel branches executes concurrently
// Fan-out: one node spawns multiple parallel branches
engine.Add("start", startNode)
engine.Add("branchA", branchANode) // Executes in parallel
engine.Add("branchB", branchBNode) // Executes in parallel
engine.Add("branchC", branchCNode) // Executes in parallel
engine.Add("merge", mergeNode)     // Results merge deterministically

// Results are deterministic regardless of completion order
final, err := engine.Run(ctx, runID, initialState)
```

**Key Features:**

- ⚡ **Performance**: 2-5x speedup for workflows with independent nodes
- 🎯 **Deterministic**: Same results regardless of execution order
- 🔄 **Replay**: Record and replay executions exactly for debugging
- 🛡️ **Backpressure**: Automatic queue management prevents resource exhaustion
- 📊 **Observability**: Built-in metrics for queue depth and active workers

**Deterministic Replay** for debugging production issues:

```go
// Original execution automatically recorded
final, err := engine.Run(ctx, "prod-run-123", initialState)

// Load checkpoint from production
checkpoint, _ := store.LoadCheckpointV2(ctx, "prod-run-123", "")

// Replay execution exactly (no external API calls)
opts := graph.Options{ReplayMode: true}
replayResult, _ := engine.ReplayRun(ctx, "debug-replay", checkpoint)

// Identical results, full debugging context
```

See [Concurrency Guide](./docs/concurrency.md) and [Replay Guide](./docs/replay.md) for details.

## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) by LangChain AI, a powerful framework for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. LangGraph-Go brings these concepts to the Go ecosystem, redesigned from the ground up to leverage Go's type system, generics, and concurrency primitives.

**Key differences from the original LangGraph:**
- **Type-safe** - Uses Go generics for compile-time type safety
- **Go-native** - Idiomatic Go design patterns and error handling
- **Concurrency-first** - Built on goroutines and channels for efficient parallelism
- **Minimal dependencies** - Pure Go core with optional external adapters

We are grateful to the LangChain AI team for pioneering the graph-based workflow approach for LLM applications. Check out the original Python implementation at https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph.
